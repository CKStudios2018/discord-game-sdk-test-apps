# discord-game-sdk-test-apps
A repo full of various Discord GameSDK sample apps

Basically a DiscordSDK for unity and unreal engine example project.
Read: https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide for more information but the way Unreal tells ya to install this is half deprecated. 
This is one of the best example you can find over the internet.
